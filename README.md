# Stroke prediction
## Objective
1. Every year, approximately 795,000 people in the United States suffer a stroke. 

2. Every year, more than 140,000 people die as a result of a stroke.

3. Approximately 40% of stroke deaths occur in men and 60% in women.

4. In the United States, there are over 7 million stroke survivors, with two-thirds of them currently disabled. Machine Learning can now be used to predict the occurrence of a stroke, thanks to advances in medical technology.

5. The purpose of this study is to determine one of the risk factors for heart disease and use logistic regression to estimate a stroke.

## Defining the Problem
1. The goal is to create a model using logistic regression to predict whether a person will have a stroke

2. Response variable and predictor variables: logit(Y) = log(p/(1-p)) = β0+ β1X1+ β2X2 + β3X3 + β4X4 + β5X5 + β6X6 

3. Response Variable: Y – Stroke (0 or 1) 

4. Predictor Variable: X – id, Gender, avg_glucose_level, age, BMI, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, smoking_status, hypertension
